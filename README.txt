CodePad is a simple yet powerful Java-based text editor.

Current Features:
	1. Ability to edit files

	3. Cut, Copy, Paste
	4. Time and Date
	5. An "About" section
	6. New, Open, Save, Save As
	7. Undo and Redo
	8. Hitting tab adds four spaces instead of eight (important for Python, etc.)
	9. Link to my GitHub page for updates
	10. Printing text files
